# Cloud Carbon Coefficients

This notebook calculates the coefficients used in [Cloud Carbon Footprint](https://www.cloudcarbonfootprint.org/), an application that estimates the energy (kilowatt hours) and carbon emissions (metric tons CO2e) from public cloud provider utilization.

These values are based on the [SPECpower_ssj2008 results](https://www.spec.org/power_ssj2008/results/). New data is released every quarter so this notebook helps calculate updated coefficients. The full results are in [data/](data/).
